## Pine

Pine is a cloud platform inspired by CloudStack aims to be a viable implementation of cloud infrastructure, esp. for new platforms, e.g. edge cloud and industrials usages. 

Pine is developing in rust and python. Reason is that Rust is robust and fast at the core and Python brings a lot of features and easy integration in the upper layers, e.g. networkin, storage, automation, etc.   


### Project Structure

> Note:
> 
> Pine follows mono-repo project structure, that contains all codes in a single directory. 
> The main reason is preventing disperse repositories specially in the beginning of the project that is imposed to wild changes.
